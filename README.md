## ü§ñ Running the bot

1. Go to the root directory of this repository.
2. Create a file named `config/token.txt` and paste your Discord bot token into it. Alternatively you can set the token via the environment variable `TURBOT_TOKEN`.
3. Create a file named `config/channels.txt` and paste a list of channels you would like Turbot to run in. Put each channel name on a new line. Alternatively you can provide channel names on the command line using any number of `--channel "name"` options.
4. Ensure that you have the proper Python 3 dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Install the application: `python setup.py install`.
6. Run the application: `turbot`.
7. For more information on supported features run: `turbot --help`.
